      Greetings, all! First of all, welcome to my blog. I'm a new student commencing Dev Bootcamp's Phase One and for many us, it will be an exiting and rewarding journey ahead. This week, we were introduced to the newly worlds of Git and Github and one of our tasks is to introduce some understanding of version control and git to readers who are new and keen to learn web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Some questions to think about: What are the benefits of version control? How does git help you keep track of changes? Why use GitHub to store your code?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the programming community, developers use version control especially Git because it keeps track of your files and adjustments to those files in a “repository”. It's a safeguard mechanism which is employed so that the user can retrieve a previous save point in different points of time so that when errors in the code occur or is broken, code can be rolled back to a certain time point. For some digital artists or content writers, they might utilize a basic form of version control such as <b><i>WordDoc - Version 1.doc</i>, <i>WordDoc - Version 2.doc</i>, <i>logodesign1.psd</i>, <i>logodesign2.psd</i></b>. For programming, this is highly error-prone and ineffective for collabratorive projects. This is why programers utilize version control software such as Git.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a widely used among developers as it is free and open source distributed version control system that is installed and lives locally on your own computer. It can be thought as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code. With Git you can view the path of these snapshots and come back to each snapshot. It makes use of an effective branching system that allows you to work on multiple independent phases of development and merge them when needed. With Git, many team members can be working on the same project at the same time. The flexibility that Git provides is that various team members can be working with one file without the fear overwriting someone else's file. And at the end, the changes can be merged into one common version without the deletion of an individual's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When your code is tracked by Git and then hosted on GitHub, it makes your code accessible for other users to view your code and assist you, if necessary. This functionality opens up the prospect of Open Source Collaboration. At the very same time, GitHub provides a backup of your files and a visual interface for navigating through your repositories. It is important to note that you can utilize Git without GitHub, however, GitHub was designed for simplified use as it was specifically made for Git.

      So I hoped you learned a few concepts about git and version control. Thank you for reading my blog!
